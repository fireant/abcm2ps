		abcm2ps command line options
		============================

The list of the command line options may be known running:
	'abcm2ps -h'

The options may be grouped when they have no argument, but the
last one (ex: "-lnGI20").

The options may be disabled when starting with '+' or ending with '-'
(ex: "+MT1" is the same as "-MT1-").

The general output format is the last found in the command line.
It may be:
	"-E" for Encapsulated PostScript, one file per tune
	"-g" for SVG, one file per tune
	"-v" for SVG, one file per page
	"-X" for XHTML+SVG
	(none) for PostScript
(see below for more information)

List of the options
-------------------

  -
	Read the abc file from stdin.

  --<format> <value>
	Set the format parameter to <value>. See format.txt.

  -a <float>
	See: format.txt - maxshrink <float>

  -A
	Annotate.
	This option inserts reference elements in the PostScript
	or SVG output.

  -B <int>, +B
	See: format.txt - barsperstaff <int>

  -b <int>
	See: format.txt - measurefirst <int>

  -c, +c
	See: format.txt - continueall <bool>

  -D <dir>
	Search the format files in the directory <dir>.

  -d <unit>
	See: format.txt - staffsep <unit>

  -E
	Produce EPS output instead of simple PS.
	In this mode, each tune goes to a different file which
	name is '<name>nnn.eps' or <title>.eps (see option '-O'
	- 'nnn' is a sequence number incremented at each tune
	- output to stdout is forbidden).
	EPS files are normally embedded into Postscript documents,
	but they may be a way to generate graphical images. For
	example, using GhostScript:
		abcm2ps voices -Ee7
		gs -sDEVICE=pngmono -r80 -g590x174 \
			-dBATCH -dNOPAUSE \
			-sOutputFile=quitolis.png Out001.eps
	(the values for -g are the values of the bounding box in
	 the .eps, multiplied by (80 / 72), where 80 is the value
	 for -r, and 72 is the default resolution)

  -e [ <tune index list> ] [ <regular expression> ]
	See: format.txt - select [ <tune index list> ] [ <regular expression> ]

  -F <file>, +F
	Read the format (or PostScript) file <file>.
	When omitted, the default type of a format file is '.fmt'.
	In the form '+F', the default format file ('default.fmt') is not
	read.

  -f
	See: format.txt - flatbeams <bool>

  -G, +G
	See: format.txt - graceslurs <bool>

  -g
	Produce SVG output instead of EPS.
	In this mode each tune goes to a different file which name
	is 'Outnnn.svg' (see option '-O').
	If the output is stdout (option '-O-'), all the SVG images
	are output without XML header.

  -H
	Display the current format values.

  -h
	Quick help, equivalent to "abcm2ps" without any arguments.
	This also shows the default settings for some parameters.

  -I <unit>
	See: format.txt - indent <unit>

  -i, +i
	Insert a red cercle around the errors in the PostScript output.

  -j <int>[b], +j
	See: format.txt - measurenb <int>

  -k <int>
	Set the size of the PostScript output buffer in Kibytes.
	Setting this value to a higher value permits the
	generation of big tunes with -E or -g.
	The default value is 64.

  -l, +l
	See: format.txt - landscape <bool>

  -M, +M
	See: format.txt - writefields w <bool>

  -m <unit>
	See: format.txt - leftmargin <unit>

  -N <int>, +N
	Number the pages.
	<int> indicates the mode:
		0  no page numbers
		1  at top left
		2  at top right
		3  at top left on even pages, top right on odd pages
		4  at top right on even pages, top left on odd pages
	For compatibility with previous versions, '+N' is the same as
	'-N0', and '-N' is the same as '-N2'.
	If a header is defined ('%%header'), this option is ignored.

  -n, +n
	See: format.txt - writehistory <bool>

  -O [ <directory> ] [ <name> ], +O
	Define the output file directory and/or name.
	By default, the output file goes to the current directory
	with a name:
		'Out.ps' for PS,
		'Outnnn.eps' for EPS (see option '-E'),
		'Outnnn.svg' for SVG (see options '-g' and '-v') or
		'Out.xhtml' for XHTML+SVG (see option '-X').
	When <name> is present, it replaces 'Out' in the file name.
	If <name> is '=', it is replaced by the name of the ABC
	source file.
	If <name> is '-', the result is output to stdout (not for EPS).
	'+O' resets the output file directory and name to their defaults.

  -q
	Quiet mode.
	When present, only the errors are shown.

  -s <float>
	See: format.txt - scale <float>

  -S
	Secure mode.
	When present, file inclusion (%%format and %%EPS) and PostScript
	injection (%%beginps and %%postscript) are disabled.

  -T <int> [ <voice> ], +T [ <int> [<voice> ] ]
	Activate or deactivate tablature drawing.
	<int> is the tablature number as defined in %%tablature.
		There may be only 8 different tablatures.
	<voice> is the voice name, full name or subname as found in V:.
		When absent, apply to all voices.
	Up to 4 such commands may be defined.
	Ex: '-T1flute +T2'
	See: format.txt - tablature

  -u
	See: format.txt - abc2pscompat <bool>

  -V
	Show the version number.

  -v
	Produce SVG output instead of simple PS.
	In this mode each page goes to a different file which name
	is 'Outnnn.svg' (see option '-O').

  -w <unit>
	See: format.txt - staffwidth <unit>

  -X
	Produce XML + SVG output instead of simple PS.
	The default file name is 'Out.xhtml' (see option '-O').

  -x, +x
	See: format.txt - writefields X <bool>

  -0, +0
	See: format.txt - splittune <bool>

  -1, +1
	See: format.txt - oneperpage <bool>
