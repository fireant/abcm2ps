		--- abcm2ps installation ---


Unix(-like) systems
===================

This version uses the GNU 'autoconf' package, so, after untarring the
sources, run:

	./configure
	make

and then, as root, do:

	make install

The 'abcm2ps' command should work if '/usr/local/bin' is in your path
(try 'abcm2ps -h' for a list of the command line options).

You may change some compile options at configure level. To know which,
run:

	configure --help


Windows or MAC systems
======================

Change the file 'config.h' according to your preferences, compile all
the '.c' files using an ANSI C compiler, and link them together. The
resulting binary file should run immediately from where it has been
generated. You may then move it at any place you want.


Testing
=======

To test the program, run it with one of the .abc files as the command
line argument:

	abcm2ps sample

The resulting file, 'Out.ps', may be displayed using a PostScript
previewer such as ghostscript, or may be sent directly to a PostScript
printer, or indirectly to a simple printer using a postscript filter.


About the 'pango' library
=========================

abcm2ps now uses the 'pango' library to render texts with non latin
characters. If you don't have such texts, you don't need this library.

In Unix(-like) systems, at configure time, the pango generation elements
are searched by pkg-config in the gdk-2.0 library. If this library or
pkg_config are not found, the rendering of non latin characters with
pango will be disabled, but this rendering may be done by other means,
especially by CMap (see the file chinese.abc). Note also that, when
pango is defined, it may be disabled at command line level by
'--pango 0' (you may try it with chinese.abc).
